## Anime Functionality Documentation

### Navigation Flow
1. Users can access anime content through:
   - Main navigation bar "Anime" link
   - Direct URL navigation to `/anime`
   - Search results linking to specific anime

### Component Structure
```
App
├── AnimeSearchPage
│   └── AnimeSearch (search functionality)
└── AnimePage
    ├── AnimeDetails (anime information)
    ├── EpisodeList (episode navigation)
    └── AnimePlayer (video playback)
```

### Expected Behavior
1. **Search Page (`/anime`)**
   - Displays search bar for anime titles
   - Shows grid of search results
   - Each result links to detailed view

2. **Details Page (`/anime/:id`)**
   - Shows comprehensive anime information
   - Lists all episodes with pagination
   - Enables video playback
   - Displays related information (genres, status, etc.)

3. **Video Playback**
   - Launches when episode is selected
   - Supports full-screen mode
   - Maintains episode progress

### Error Handling
- Loading states for API requests
- Fallback UI for failed requests
- Invalid route handling
- Network error messages
- Empty state handling

### API Integration
- Uses Jikan API (MyAnimeList)
- Endpoints:
  - `/anime` (search)
  - `/anime/{id}/full` (details)
  - `/anime/{id}/episodes` (episode list)

### Current Implementation
- All routes properly configured
- Components structured for modularity
- Error boundaries implemented
- Loading states added
- Responsive design across devices
